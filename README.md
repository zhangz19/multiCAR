# multiCAR
Multi-resolution CAR model for spatial areal data  

* The code is developed for modeling spatial areal data with multi-resolution nested spatial random effects. For each resolution (group level), it has options: nonrandom, spatial (CAR), WLS (spatially weighted Least-Square) and OLS (Ordinary Least-Square with i.i.d. assumption). It returns DIC4 for model comparisons with different model ID.
